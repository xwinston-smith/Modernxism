# What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a digital ledger, or a kind of database, that records transactions or other types of data in a secure and transparent way. It uses cryptography to keep the information safe from unauthorized access, and because it is decentralized, meaning that there is no single entity that controls it, it is considered to be tamper-proof.

The technology gets its name from the way it stores data in "blocks" that are linked together in a chain-like structure. Each block contains a set of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered without changing all the subsequent blocks as well. This makes it very difficult to tamper with the data, which is one of the key features of blockchain.

The most well-known application of blockchain is in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it has many other potential uses, such as for supply chain management, voting systems, and even creating digital identities. The possibilities are endless, and many experts believe that blockchain has the potential to transform the way we do business and interact with one another online.

Think of blockchain like a big notebook that a group of people share. Whenever someone does something, like buying a car or selling a house, they write it down in the notebook. Everyone in the group can see what's written in the notebook, and they all have a copy of it.

But the special thing about this notebook is that once something is written down, it can't be erased or changed. And if someone wants to add something new to the notebook, they have to get everyone else in the group to agree that it's okay to add it.

This makes the notebook very secure because everyone can see what's written in it, and no one can change what's already been written without everyone else knowing about it. This is like how the blockchain is secure because it's decentralized and everyone can see the transactions that have been recorded.

# Blockchain Villages

Assume you are living under an oppressive government and want to start a new village. You have 100 interested people who want to join, and you found the best location on the border of your current country.

To ensure a fair and decentralized system in your new village, you decide that everyone must have equal voting power and that the member accounts must be held in a trustworthy manner.

To achieve this, you propose creating a blockchain-based member account network where each member saves the data on their computer, connected through the internet.

This network ensures that every member backs up each other's accounts, preventing any one person from having arbitrary control. To add or revoke members, a grant must be approved by a majority of the network.

This blockchain-based system ensures a fair and secure process for managing member accounts in your new village.

# Land and territories

It is necessary for the village to declare a specific territory. This can be achieved through the use of GPS technology to mark specific points and connect them to create a delineated area.

After the declaration of the territory, the management of the area becomes a critical issue. The ownership of the area in that territory is shared by all members of the village. Any member who wishes to purchase land within the territory can do so by paying an equal amount to all other members. Additionally, the member who owns the land must pay land tax to the rest of the members, based on the tax rate as follows:

- For land with an area of less than 100 square meters, the tax rate is 0% of the property value.
- For land with an area greater than 100 square meters, the tax rate is X% of the property value to prevent excessive land ownership beyond necessity.

Furthermore, all economic activities within the territory that generate taxes will be distributed equally among all members.

In the next section, we will provide you with information about the monetary system that you can use for trading or exchanging.

# Monetary systems

The monetary system was originally created and controlled by a centralized bank under government authority. To ensure democratic control over the monetary system, we propose a decentralized approach where every member holds equal power.

To achieve this, we will integrate the monetary network into the existing blockchain node, which will be governed by the same member network rules and regulations.

( If any member violates the law of the network, other members have the authority to temporarily suspend their account and prohibit them from using any of their assets for a certain period of time. )

# Law and Adjudication Processes

In order to safeguard the rights of individuals within the group, it is imperative to have a legal framework in place. The laws will be formulated and ratified by all members, in accordance with the principle of majority rule, and will be stored in the same blockchain node.

If any member contravenes these laws, a majority vote will be held by all members to determine appropriate action.

# Representative Organization

Suppose that there are 100 million individuals who suffer from disillusionment due to an oppressive government, and they seek to join your village, thereby transforming it into a country. Once the members of the village agree to expand and welcome new members to their blockchain, they claim the territory by using a GPS plot on a map.

Following the establishment of the new country, some members express the desire to give it a name. However, with such a vast number of members hailing from distinct backgrounds, reaching a consensus regarding the new country's name becomes a formidable challenge.

To overcome this challenge, rather than holding individual votes, the adoption of a representative organization becomes necessary. A representative organization is an independent group of people among the members that operates similarly to a corporation while acting as a political party. Each member is issued a unique key (token), which they use to authorize their participation in the voting process.

While it is practical for members to cast individual votes in smaller scale scenarios, reaching a consensus among 100 million members is nearly impossible. This necessitates the establishment of an RO, which functions as a company or organization providing services to its members while collecting taxes. Members will register with the RO, providing their key for voting purposes, and their tax contribution will be calculated based on their income.

With many ROâ€™s services available, members will select the RO that they deem most suitable. Upon registering with the RO of their choice, members provide their key and grant the organization the authority to manage their rights and cast votes on their behalf.

# Balancing Power Through Monetary Systems

When contemplating the possibility of an individual or organization attempting to take over a system, particularly one with significant power, such as the military, there is a need to consider the measures that must be taken to prevent such an occurrence. As a general population, it is imperative to devise a strategy that ensures that nobody can arbitrarily take control of the system.

It is worth noting that every powerful system or organization depends on humans for its operation. In the absence of humans, the system will cease to function. Each individual has fundamental needs, such as food, water, and energy supply, which can only be obtained through reliance on a social system that employs a medium of exchange, namely money. As previously stated, the monetary system belongs to everyone, and it requires the agreement of the majority to operate effectively. Consequently, if a person or organization seeks to take control of the system without the approval of the majority, they can be sanctioned by refusal to trade, thereby depriving them of access to critical resources such as electricity, water, and even food. Furthermore, if an individual or organization proves to be a danger to the system, the population may collectively vote to revoke their citizenship, ban their wallet accounts, or temporarily stop accessing their access, rendering their access to the monetary system impossible.
